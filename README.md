## Day 2

Slightly shuddering on basic regex

## Day 3

Today I learned a little about .Aggregate, thanks [Anders](https://github.com/lynxz)!

## Day 4

Eeek. More regex! learned the importance of strict ^...$ but i have to say, MAYBE i'm getting the hang of regex... my webclient reader broke though. need to fix that at some point, for now, copy paste ftw!
## Day 5
That was a nice refresher on recursion!

## Day 8
missed out updating yesterday, maybe the past few days have been too brutal. Great solutions coming from [Anders](https://github.com/lynxz/AdventOfCode/tree/master/2020) though! 

## Day 12
Took a long time to find the recursive function for me, literally had to step through a number of iterations. Happy that i was able to refactor and make it work for part 1 as well!
