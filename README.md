## Day 2

Slightly shuddering on basic regex

## Day 3

Today I learned a little about .Aggregate, thanks [Anders](https://github.com/lynxz)!

## Day 4

Eeek. More regex! learned the importance of strict ^...$ but i have to say, MAYBE i'm getting the hang of regex... my webclient reader broke though. need to fix that at some point, for now, copy paste ftw!
## Day 5
That was a nice refresher on recursion!
