# Advent of Code 2021

## [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/11)
Spent way too much time debugging all because i did - instead of +. Meanwhile, i made a batch file to make setup easier. 

## Day 5

I'm sure there was a math way to solve this... Some good solutions i found through reddit:
- [jasonincanada](https://github.com/jasonincanada/aoc-2021/blob/main/AdventOfCode/AdventOfCode.CSharp/Day05.cs)

## Day 4

Well, I tried to get a headstart at using regex but eventually back pedalled and used old reliable string split.

## Day 3

Note to self there is a built in binary parser

`Convert.Int32("1010101", 2);`


## Day 2

Tried to use things I learned last year [.Aggregate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.aggregate?view=net-6.0). Started to package some tools as well to simplify getting input, stealing implement from Anders.

## Day 1

Was not prepared, so here it is, as is. :) As usual, great solution from [Anders](https://github.com/lynxz) https://github.com/lynxz/AdventOfCode/blob/master/2021/Day01/Program.cs Need to start doing using Linq more! Made an update to try to use [C# Ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/ranges)

If any christmas needs saving, this one does!

## Day 2

Slightly shuddering on basic regex

## Day 3

Today I learned a little about .Aggregate, thanks [Anders](https://github.com/lynxz)!

## Day 4

Eeek. More regex! learned the importance of strict ^...$ but i have to say, MAYBE i'm getting the hang of regex... my webclient reader broke though. need to fix that at some point, for now, copy paste ftw!

## Day 5

That was a nice refresher on recursion!

## Day 8

missed out updating yesterday, maybe the past few days have been too brutal. Great solutions coming from [Anders](https://github.com/lynxz/AdventOfCode/tree/master/2020) though!

## Day 10

This was really neat https://github.com/FaustVX/adventofcode/blob/master/2020/Day10/Solution.cs

## Day 11

Took a long time to find the recursive function for me, literally had to step through a number of iterations. Happy that i was able to refactor and make it work for part 1 as well!

## Day 12

Saw this very elegant solution: https://github.com/FaustVX/adventofcode/blob/master/2020/Day12/Solution.cs

## Day 13

~~Officially skipping day 13 part 2...~~
Did TDD and finally came up with the solution! Why didn't I do that first, could have avoided wasting a day!

## Day 14

As the problems are getting more difficult, i've decided to do part 1 first thing in the morning before work and then part 2 at the end of the day. So far it is working out.
Here are a few solutions i want to study when i have the time:
